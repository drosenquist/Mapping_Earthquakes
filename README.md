# Mapping_Earthquakes
Purpose of this challange was to map earthquakes and their relation to tectonic plates on earth. The map provides locations markers which are colored and sized based on the magnitude of the earthwake. Also, the maps allows users toggle different data off and on (show all earthquakes, majore earthwakres over 4.5, and tectonic plate locations). Users can also toggle between different map views (street, satilite, and dark).
